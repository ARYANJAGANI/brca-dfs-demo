"""
app.py

A small, standalone demo web app for the BRCA disease-free survival (DFS)
recurrence model. This is separate from the PredictMod platform submission,
it is just a simple browser interface for demoing the model (for example, at
the volunteership symposium), where someone can fill in one patient's
clinical and genomic details and immediately see a prediction.

How to run it:
    pip install flask joblib pandas
    python app.py

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser.
